# Event-Based Programming

## Polyglot AB 2015

Calgary's first Polyglot un-conference is being held on March 28 2015.

This is our elevator pitch for why you should vote for our presentation
at Polyglot.

## Languages

There is a working implementation of a chat server (and client)
implemented in both Python and C++. Public accessible server, this
git repo contains all the code and the presentation itself.

## Presenters

With a combined experience of almost 40 years, Mike Warren & Kurt Neufeld
are very familiar with both Python and C++.

They've even done a bit of event based programming.

Seriously, for all your event based polyglot presentation needs, look
no further!
